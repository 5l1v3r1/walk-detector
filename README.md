# walk-detector
An android app that notifies you when you are walking for selected period of time

This is a simple app that will remind the user to turn some walk related apps, when he or she starts walking. 
For example a charity app which donates money when you walk.

The project will use the Google sensors API.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. :)
